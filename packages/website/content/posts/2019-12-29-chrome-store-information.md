### How Does It Work?

It all starts with an Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO LCA) that is provided by a retailer. This assessment attempts to account for the carbon emissions incurred in creating an item. The assessment generally includes estimates of the carbon intensity for the following activities: production of the inputs, transportation, packaging and electricity. Some retailers (such as Amazon) release aggregate numbers for the estimated carbon released per dollar of revenue from the EIO LCA. Others do not publish these numbers, so Carbon Calculator relies on publicly available data to estimate this metric.

Then, on supported websites, Carbon Calculator will appear at the bottom of the page if it detects a price on the page. Carbon Calculator then uses the retailer's EIO LCA to estimate the carbon footprint of the item on the page.

### What Websites Are Supported?

Carbon Calculator currently supports the following websites:
