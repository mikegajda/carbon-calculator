Welcome to the Carbon Calculator Blog. Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Mike Dever [@mikendever](https://twitter.com/mikendever) and I'll be working on improving Carbon Calculator for the next few months.

### How Did This Get Started?

Last year was really a watershed year for the climate movement. Advocates like [Greta Thunberg](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg
) and organizations like [Sunshine Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org) showed that the climate crisis could—and should—be a top-tier issue. While the increase in attention (albeit still not enough) has made more people aware of the crisis, it's clear that we need further change to avoid catastrophe.

As someone who for much of his life did not recycle, didn't think about reusing things and had the privilege of access to a lot of material things, I've found that I need to change my thinking and make up for lost time. I've reduced my meat consumption, begun composting, and now shop in second-hand stores instead of buying new all the time. Though these steps are significant, I know there's a lot more to do.

One of my particular weaknesses is online shopping: it's still amazing to me that with the push of a button seemingly anything can be delivered by Amazon/Target/Walmart in one or two days. I began wondering just how much of an impact my shopping habits have, and  I came across [Amazon's Carbon Methodology Paper](https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/a4/ad/b9eca67e4578b35e8f995c8b4f9c/amazon-carbon-methodology-september-2019.pdf) which arrives at a carbon emission rate per dollar spent: 128 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>. In the abstract this is useful, but I think the _aha moment_ came when I was looking at a pair of Apple AirPods and realized that if I bought them I'd also be buying 48 pounds (~21 kg for those of you who prefer the metric system). I wanted to get this information on all pages I was browsing and started developing Carbon Calculator.

### How Does It Work?

Carbon Calculator at launch only works on Amazon.com pages (that means it's US only for now). Once you install it in Chrome ([instructions here]()) you'll get a banner at the bottom of your page with the estimated carbon footprint of the item you're browsing. I'm working hard on bringing this technology to other websites.

Here's what Carbon Calculator looks like once you've installed it:

### Will This Solve the Climate Crisis?

No! Let's disabuse ourselves of any notion that this will solve the climate crisis. Carbon Calculator is meant only to be informational and to hopefully nudge users towards purchasing less. My hope is that everyone who uses Carbon Calculator will think twice next time they make an impulsive Amazon/Walmart/Target purchase, and that together we can begin to be more mindful of our purchases.
